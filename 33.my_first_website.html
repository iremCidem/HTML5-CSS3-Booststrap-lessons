<h1 style="color:aqua ;">Top 3 song lyrics</h1>
<h3>The weekend / Blinding Lights </h3>
<pre style="font-style:italic ;">I've been tryna call
    I've been on my own for long enough
    Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
    I'm going through withdrawals
    You don't even have to do too much
    You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
    I look around and
    <mark> Sin City's cold and empty (oh)</mark>
    No one's around to judge me (oh)
    I can't see clearly when you're gone</pre>
<h3>Kate bush / Running Up That Hill</h3>
<pre style="font-style:italic ;">It doesn’t hurt me
    Do you want to feel how it feels?
    Do you want to know, know that it doesn’t hurt me?
    Do you want to hear about the deal that I’m making?
    You, it’s you and me
    
    And if I only could
    <mark>I’d make a deal with god </mark>
    And I’d get him to swap our places
    Be running up that road
    Be running up that hill
    Be running up that building
    See if I only could, ooh
    </pre>
<h3>Lola Jane / Leave You</h3>
<pre style="font-style:italic ;">I wanna another lover
     I wanna feel somebody new
      I wanna feel another 
      <mark> Lately I have been confused </mark> 
      But I don't know which way to go
       I guess that I will never know 
       If I don't leave you
</pre>
