    <p>It is impossible not to be impressed by <strong> Bali</strong> by looking at the rice fields
         stretching out of the picture, its lush nature, its unique culture and
         the turquoise waters of the ocean surrounding it. The temperature here 
         is around 25-35 degrees on average throughout the year. Thanks to its 
         tropical climate, it can be said that it is possible to go to <strong> Bali</strong> all
          year round. We say it can be said because the tropical climate zone also
           means that you can encounter rain at any time. The period from mid-April
            to mid-October is the most ideal time.</p>
